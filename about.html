    <p>Hi! My name is AJ. I'm currently going to NJIT for a M.S. in Information Systems. My goal is to become a web developer.</p>
    <p>I'm also in two bands! I'm in an up and coming bar band that covers pop punk and 90's alternative called Wake up, Paul!. I also have a pop punk solo project called <a id="bandLink" target="_blank" href="https://faultyparachute.bandcamp.com">Faulty Parachute</a></p>

    <p>I started playing guitar in 2009, a solid <b>19 years ago!!!</b> I bought my first guitar after saving up lunch money for half a year and essentially starving myself since my parents didn't want to buy me one. That first guitar ended up being a First Act, which can be seen below.</p>

    <p>A few years later, my Dad decided to help me out and got me an amp and a new guitar! My first amp was an AC30, which I miss greatly. My second guitar was a Dean Bocca, which I named Jasmin. She is still my main guitar to this day.</p>
