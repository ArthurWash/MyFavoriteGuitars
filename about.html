    <p>I started playing guitar in 2009, a solid <b>19 years ago!!!</b> I bought my first guitar after saving up lunch money for half a year and essentially starving myself since my parents didn't want to buy me one. That first guitar ended up being a First Act, which can be seen below.</p>

    <p>A few years later, my Dad decided to help me out and got me an amp and a new guitar! My first amp was an AC30, which I miss greatly. My second guitar was a Dean Bocca, which I named Jasmin. She is still my main guitar to this day.</p>
