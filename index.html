        <p> Whaddup! This is a practice website I created to practice HTML and CSS.</p>
        <br>
        <p> On this main page, I'll list my top five guitars</p>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li> <u>1. Gibson Les Paul</u>
                <br>
                <br>
                <a target="_blank" href="https://bit.ly/3NBzo4A"><img src="images/LesPaul.png" alt="Gibson Les Paul, Maroon" onclick="imgClick('Gibson')"></a>
                <br>
                <br>
                This is my dream guitar that I hope to buy when I get a full time coding job!</li>
            <br>
            <br>
            <li> <u>2. Fender Telecaster</u>
                <br>
                <br>
                <a target="_blank" href="https://bit.ly/3NGsgEc"><img src="images/Telecaster.png" alt="Fender Telecaster, Dark Night" onclick="imgClick('Fender')"></a>
                <br>
                <br>
                I've always enjoyed the design and sound of the telecaster. If I was ever made of money, I would definitely buy a Telecaster alongside a Les Paul \m/
            </li>
            <br>
            <br>
            <li> <u>3. Epiphone ES-333</u>
                <br>
                <br>
                <a target="_blank" href="https://bit.ly/38t74m8"><img src="images/ES-333.png" alt="Tom Delonge signature custom Epiphone ES-333, 2009" onclick="imgClick('Epiphone')"></a>
                <br>
                <br>
                Any blink-182 fan will immediately recgonize this guitar and understand why it's on my list. A custom guitar made by Tom Delonge, I just love the design and the sound it gave for blink's self titled album.
            </li>
            <br>
            <br>
            <li> <u>4. Ibanez Iceman</u>
                <br>
                <br>
                <a target="_blank" href="https://bit.ly/3wPrqiO"><img src="images/Iceman.png" alt="Ibanez Iceman, black" onclick="imgClick('Ibanez')"></a>
                <br>
                <br>
                Another guilty pleasure guitar from my childhood. I grew up with System of a Down, and was obsessed with the Iceman because of their guitarist Daron Malakian who used it. Always thought it was a really cool, unique guitar. 
                It also has a beefy sound for that alternative metal we love!
            </li>
            <br>
            <br>
            <li> <u>5. Martin Acoustic Guitars</u>
                <br>
                <br>
                <a target="_blank" href="https://bit.ly/3NBBMs8"><img src="images/Martin.png" alt="Martin co. acoustic guitar, natural wood finish" onclick="imgClick('Martin')"></a>
                <br>
                <br>
                Couldn't only have electric guitars up here! Martin guitars are the ephinany of quality and design. Taking a tour of their workshop is an amazing experience. I hope someday to be able to afford one to iclude in my arsenal.
