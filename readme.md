Hi!

This is a practice website I created on my own to practice my HTML and CSS skills. 

I decided to make a website dedicated to guitars that I love, as well as guitarists who inspired me. 

Some concepts I was specifically focusing on include practicing positions, stylesheets, creating a navbar, special effects (for example, how when you hover over the pictures they expand, how a link reacts to certain events like hovering over a link, clicking a link, etc.), and lists.

This is a work in progress, so please excuse any links or elements that don't work!
